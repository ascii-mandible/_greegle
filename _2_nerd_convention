Its kind of a nerd convention here today. The most senior senior VP of Product
Management is holding court. We usually use our biweekly Wednesday meetings to
show off our hard-fought wares to the boss but this week we're playing host to a
bunch of east coast math geeks who want a shot at getting bought out after
plugging away at their startups for a whole six months. I had a presentation
ready for this meeting, queued up in Keynote last night after running through a
few lines of blow. And now my meeting is being interrupted by mouth breathers.

They are trying to make polite but smart conversation with the boss while
showing off the features they have built. I have seen the precipice of
terrifying intelligence and it is here before me in this room. A soft, well
groomed asian male in his late 20s is leaning over his laptop demo'ing a slick
map feature on the bigscreen. I say its a 'feature' not a 'product' because
that's what it is. It's what these hackers make. Most of them are incredibly
intelligent but have very dull imaginations. They can't imagine new things, but
they can iterate on original ideas that already exist. Invariably what they
present in meetings like this when they want their startups bought is a feature
that goes into an existing product, and what they are peddling is not the
business they have built around this feature but their talents for doing so.

A few of them must have either gone to the same schools or contributed to the
same code pools, I can't quite tell. It's in the way they eye each other; each
knowing how good the other is but not wanting to let on. They all want a chance
here in the Greegle product lottery, but only one of them will get the nod and
come aboard because their products are all too similar. Talking to them is like
watching the hands on a clock move. You can see the ticking, you're just not
entirely sure what's inside making it all happen; whatever it is -- its probably
almost entirely mechanical anyway.

The Laptop guy shows off a particularly slick piece of app on the screen and my
boss is suitably impressed and leans back in his chair to look at it. Laptop
casually mentions that he wanted to do more with it but it was all he could do
in a day. His voice trails off and the sound of the projector fan fills the dark
spaces in the room. Honestly, what a lying whore. My mind's eye rolls up into
itself because what he just said is the computer science equivalent of Laptop
taking his underwear off and throwing it at my boss' head like a vixen.

The sheer tension in the room from everyone's assholes being so tight is
beginning to pucker me and so I start checking my phone for email like a slot
machine of distraction. My boss' boss is scanning the room but is far away deep
in thought; his dead eyes rest just above me on the wall but I know he is miles
away, charting roadmaps, envisioning the future. Like a v-necked sorcerer gazing
into a crystal ball. I heard the reason he is so successful is because he never
had children and the reason he never had children was because he was sterile and
one look into his dead eyes during our first meeting and I understood that it
was true. I wonder how many men have accidentally sterilized themselves with
their phones in Silicon Valley. Luckily I don't have to worry about that because
my girlfriend takes the pill.
