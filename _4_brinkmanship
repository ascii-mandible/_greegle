Do you see the way he undermines me publicly? I'm going to compile all these
into a book about bad management styles one day. He does this *every single
time*. It's like he wants to obscure the fact that I am the creative powerhouse
of our little collaboration so he pulls power plays to obfuscate the truth. I
think he's afraid that Ingrid, Ryan and I will hit it off as creatives and plan
the roadmap without his input. Also, I may have lied about Deathbird's vet
appointment being on Wednesday.

Do you want me to stop off at the store and get those little eggplants you like?
I'll make you a sexy dinner.

Hi everyone,

Great news, I just found out that Bethany Cankles in HR can re-schedule
orientation for the Porters to around 1pm on Monday just after lunch; that means
that we can probably fit the 11am meeting in after all! I'll walk the Porters
over to Building C for lunch with myself and the other SVP's afterwards.

See you then!
Bob

    Greetings again, Ingrid!

    I just got off the phone with Rabbit Murrow in accounting and he let me know
    that it would be possible to shuffle things around a bit if you're game. He
    and Jesse White from legal can meet you on Wednesday down here instead. Of
    course, only if Matt Strunk is able to make it with you. If we move that
    meeting to Wednesday then I think Bob and I can meet you on Tuesday.
    Let us know.

    --Mike

        Unfortunately we're having our cat's nipples lasered on Wednesday and
        will need to be at the vet's office no later than noon. Do you by chance
        have any openings on Tuesday?

            Hey Mike,

            Just got off the phone with the Porters and it looks like we're
            going to have to move the meeting to Wednesday at 4pm. Will you be
            up in the city that day?

            Bob
