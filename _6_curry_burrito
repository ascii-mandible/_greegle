I'm eating an Indian burrito while walking down the steps to BART, fumes of bum
urine and tortilla-wrapped curry chicken alternately wafting through my nostrils.
I'll opt for the steps instead of the escalator on days when I've got something
to eat in my hands because last year the city had to disassemble the escalators
because something kept stopping them up.

Yeah, San Francisco has a homeless problem. And right now I have a burrito
problem. Thing is the size of my arm and I have to get it into my body and
digesting by noon. No carbs or starches in the afternoon; I want my body to be
in a carb-free ketosis by the time I hit the gym after work. These abs aren't
going to grow themselves.

Oh, and in case you were wondering about the escalators -- it was poop.
