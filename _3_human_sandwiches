Sometimes I just want to be alone in the crowd so I go to a neighborhood bar
called the Bluebird to order a glass or two of wine, sit in the back with a good
book and take it all in. I read because its useless; there's nobody interesting
left in San Francisco. They are all dead or have been priced out of the housing
market by techies and moved to places like Detroit or Berlin. I question myself
for still living here as I overhear the bland couple behind me in full techie
courtship, discussing the nuances of balancing car-payments with fiscal
responsibility. The conversation is bland. Their relationship seems to contain
the emotional nutrition of a Subway Sandwich. Perhaps less. Did I mention they
were bland? There's nothing left to do in this city but get rich. I suck down
the rest of my embalming fluid and go home.
